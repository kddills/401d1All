Readings: Threat Analysis, Cyber Kill-Chain, and Stuxnet

The Cybersecurity Kill Chain is a model that describes the steps an attacker must complete to carry out a successful attack. This is a model that is made up of 7 sequential steps: 

1.Reconnaissance
2.Weaponization
3.Delivery
4.Exploitation
5.Installation
6.Command and Control
7.Actions on Objectives

In order to disrupt the attack, one or more of these steps must be broken for the entire chain to fail. The kill chain is more than a model for how an attack is executed, itâ€™s also a blueprint for building a good cybersecurity program. By using multiple layers of security throughout each phase, we make it more and more challenging for the attacker to be successful.
