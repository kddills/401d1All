Readings: Web Application Threat Modeling with OWASP, DREAD
Threat modelling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something valuable. It can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, things in the internet of things, business processes and more. There are fre technical products which canâ€™t be threat modelled. Threat modelling can be done at any stage of development, preferably early so that the findings can inform the design.
