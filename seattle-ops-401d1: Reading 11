Readings: Network Packet Analysis with Wireshark

This was an interesting read about how to use Wireshark to steal passwords. Wireshark is a great tool to capture the network packets. Wireshark is a tool that you can use to access the packet and their information with passwords. You can capture the network packets that contain passwords. Capturing network packets in general is easy when you have administrative rights. It basically works like, 

1) All the packets on the network that actually arrive at your PCs (or Mac) will be inspected to check if they have a destination that matches the network card
2) If the destination address is a match, the packets are destined for your PC and will be passed up to the CPU and processed
3) If the destination address in the packet does not match the address of the network card the packets will simply be ignored and discarded

You can’t get easy access to packets of other users, and you can’t decrypt the sessions that hold the things you want to see most. If you only look at unencrypted things, and only on networks, you have administrative access to.
