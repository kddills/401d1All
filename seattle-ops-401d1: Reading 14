Readings: Cloud Network Traffic Analysis
Traffic mirroring in an Amazon VPC features that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out of band security and monitoring appliances for content inspection, threat monitoring, troubleshooting. The security and monitoring appliances can be deployed as individual instances or as a fleet of instances behind a Network Load Balancer with a UDP listener. Traffic Mirroring supports filters and packet truncation, so that you only extract the traffic of interest to monitor by using monitoring tools of your choice.
