Readings: Threat Modeling with DFDs, STRIDE
Everyone wants to build secure software, but it’s not simply a checkbox you select. There are a number of factors, from how you validate input to the libraries you choose that could cause vulnerabilities. Threat modeling provides a little preparation that can help you identify blind spots in your application’s security. There are many types of spoofing, from the teenager’s fake ID to more serious infiltration of technology systems. A major area of concern is network security, as much of our connected devices are dependent upon trusting the identity of other devices. In these systems, passwords, keys, tokens, and signatures are among the methods used to authenticate requests. The level of vulnerability varies based on the method. Now that you know the six areas to evaluate, put it into practice. When you begin new projects, proactively consider how STRIDE applies. Either by yourself or with your team, evaluate how each area could be exploited, then plan the steps to limit each threat.
